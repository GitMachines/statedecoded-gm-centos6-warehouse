## About

Supplies needed for more reliable build of State Decoded

The warehouse is available to keep project specific copies of upstream supply chain resources insuring supplies are available.

## Example

In December 2013, VaCode.org link to code.xml.zip failed. 

Because it failed, statedecoded-gm-centos6 one-click build and install failed. 

Fortunately, through the magic of Git, a local copy of code.xml.zip was found. 

The best solution is store a local copy of the VaCode.org's code.xml.zip.
